# Seestar_Alp

Seestar ALP is a standalone controller, for command, control, and scheduling of SeeStar telescopes.

It uses a webpage based interface running on your computer, to interact with a backend server that controls the telescope.


### Where do I start?

That depends on your goals. (of course)

If you want to get in and learn the code and see how it all works then you can clone this git repository or download the code from the release, or from the main branch.  You will be interested in the ./device and ./front directories at first.

If you just want to use the GUI and commnicate with your Seestar then the standalone install may be right for you. The standalone install is described below.
